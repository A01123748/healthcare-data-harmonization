# XmlToJson tool

The XmlToJson tool, is intended to convert Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)
XML files to JSON.

## Summary

The XmlToJson is a first stage parser, which is in charge of parsing CCDA XML
files to JSON files. The key component of this tool is the
[JAXB library](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/index.html).

This library allows XmlToJson tool to unmarshal XML files into JAVA objects and
then marshall them back as JSON. The JAVA classes defining the unmarshalled
objects are generated by
[XJC tool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/xjc.html).

XJC tool generates the JAVA classes based on the XSD schema defining the XML
files to be unmarshalled; in our case the schemas of interest correspond to the
different
[CCDA](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=492)
revisions.

## How to build

### Dependencies

The following dependencies should be installed and available in the path of the
system:

Dependency  | Tested versions
------- | --------
[XJC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/xjc.html) | `2.2.8-b130911.1802` `2.2.8-b130911.1802`

### Schemas

Only
[HL7 v3 CCDA Release 2](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7)
is supported at this moment. Even though, the tool should be extensible to
support more versions.

Please add the schemas for CCDA Release 2 in directory `src\main\javaschemas\ccdarev2`
making sure there is a top-level file called `CDA.xsd` in the root of the
previous directory.

### Build steps

After previous steps are ready, please execute a gradle build by using
the provided `build.gradle` script.
